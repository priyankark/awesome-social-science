## Aphorisms / Adages / Epigrams

#### [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

> Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected

For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number
of possible and more complex alternatives, but simpler theories are more preferable
because they are easily testable. This is a line of reasoning often used in daily life.

#### [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)

> Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

A special case of Occam's razor, the history of this aphorism is controversial,
but the applications are endless. [Miscommunications are often attributed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/48#issuecomment-118540912)
to this aphorism in Open Source Projects.

#### [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)

> If anything can go wrong -- it will.

People most often relate with `If there is a worse time for something to go wrong,
it will happen then.`, especially after the dawn of mobile communication (no coverage
right when you need it most) and the Internet (no connectivity, when you have to send
that one life-changing email.)

#### [Godwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)

> As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1

In many newsgroups, it is a tradition in which whoever mentions the Nazis automatically
loses the debate that was going on, and the thread is finished there and then. Also, popularly
referred to as `Playing the Hitler card`.

#### [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

>  Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. 

This adage explains why you end up studying the majority of your syllabus one day before the exam  
despite the fact that you probably had over a week to study. Interestingly, it is used to   
explain the inefficiencies of bureaucratic systems. Having earlier deadlines can be a way to get   
around the problem.

## Psychological Syndromes

#### [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)

> When the victim mistakes a lack of abuse as an act of kindness by the captor.

Traumatic bonding that is most common in kidnapping situations, where the hostages
express sympathy towards the captor, to the point of defending the captors. It may be
attributed to the natural selection process that let our hunter-gatherer ancestors
solve adaptive problems.

#### [Pygmalion effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect)

> the phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an increase in performance

The idea behind this effect is that if a leader expects more of a follower, then the follower tends to
improve their performance. Studies of this effect in action are hard to conduct because they are generally
in an artificial, manipulated setting. Also, there is an argument that often the perception of a follower
by the leader directly or indirectly affect the expectations that said leader has from the follower. This
effect was shown to exist in schools in the Rosenthal-Jacobson study.

#### [Golem Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect)

> The phenomenon where lower expectations placed upon individuals leads to poorer performance

The Golem effect is the negative corrollary of the Pygmalion Effect: Supervisors
with negative expectations will inadvertently produce behaviours that reduce the
efficiency of their subordinates. This effect has been most rigorously studied
in Classroom settings. Teachers treat students performing poorly with high
negative bias, this in turn leads the students to perform poorly, reinforcing
the teacher's belief. This is one of the most problematic consequences of Golem
Effect in the Classroom. A few studies have also been made on the Golem effect
in the workplace.

#### [Capgras Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion)

> Delusion that an individual's closed ones have been replaced by a double.

![image](./img/Capgras-Syndrome.png)

Capgras Syndrome(a.k.a Capgras Delusion) is a psychiatric disorder in which a
person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family
member (or pet) has been replaced by an identical impostor. There is no
definitive diagnosis available.

#### [Hawthorne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect)

> People behave better or improve their productivity when under observation

The Hawthorne effect (a.k.a Observation Bias) was first noticed at Hawthorne
Works in Cicero, IL where the correlation between lighting conditions and
employee producitivty was studied. Critics who doubt that a correlation exists
in reality argue that the Hawthorne effect is a variant of the demand effect.
Richard Nisbett, a distinguished professor of social psychology, has described
the Hawthorne effect as "a glorified anecdote", saying that "once you have got
the anecdote, you can throw away the data."
